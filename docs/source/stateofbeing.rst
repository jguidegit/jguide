State of Being 
===============

Nouns 
^^^^^^
In Japanese, nouns have no number or gender, and there are no articles.

Pluralizing: You can generally use ～たち to make things plural, but this suffix usually points out a group of things/people. In this sense, it is not like the simple "-s" suffix for plurals in English. [l7]

Pronouns 
^^^^^^^^^^
Japanese has many pronouns that differ in politeness, gender orientation, etc. All pronouns come from words that referred to people.

State of Being 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A copula is a word that links the subject with its predicate [wiki]. In English, it is the word "is." The plain form of the copula in Japanese is「だ」which is used to expresse existence. State of being can also be implied without the use of「だ」[stateofbeing]. The key difference is that 「だ」explicitly declares something which sounds more emphatic and forceful [stateofbeing]. だ can only be used with a noun (名詞・めいし) or na-adjective (形容動詞・けいようどうし) [stateofbeing].::
