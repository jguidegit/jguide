Sentence Structure
====================
The typical structure of a sentence; subject (item of disscusion in a sentence), followed by the object (what an action is directed at), and the verb (the action or state of being) is awlays at the end. The most basic sentence only requires a verb to be grammatically correct. Particles go after words to show a grammatical function [l6, direct]. 

Sentences are often structured from most important information first.
